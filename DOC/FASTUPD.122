New Features
----------------------------------------------------------------------

ALARM
  - Now honors UseDrag if defined in OPDEFINE.INC

  - Added a new function, ValidPointer, which determines whether or
    not a pointer contains a valid address (protected mode only)

IDE Help text
  - Object Professional now ships with a Borland Pascal 7.0 IDE
    help file called OPRO.TPH.  See the READ.1ST file for 
    installation instructions.

OPCTRL
  - According to the CUA specification, the spacebar should select
    the currently focused PushButton.  PushButton.Edit now recognizes
    both the ENTER key and the spacebar as selection keys.

OPDEVICE
  - Added registration routine, PanasonicKXP2124Register, for
    the Panasonic KX-P2124 printer
  - Added a generic bold font capability for LJII and compatible
    printers

    PrintedForm's Printer object in a stream.

OPMENU
  - Span headers are now treated like window borders when drawn

OPMOUSE
  - SaveMouseState had an upper limit of 1024 bytes to store the
    state of the mouse.  The Microsoft 9.01 mouse driver exceeds
    this limit.  Accordingly, the upper limit was changed to
    2048 bytes.

  - Multiple MoreHeaders can now safely overlap one another
  - pkDrawItem is now a virtual method

  - Code was added to work around a bug in Cyrix processors

    if the initialization code fails
