!TOPIC 280 OpColor
This unit is provided strictly as a convenience for users who would prefer
to use named constants, rather than hexadecimal numbers, to refer to video
attributes. Use of this unit is entirely optional. A complete list of the
constants defined in OpColor appears below.

Within Object Professional, OpColor is used only by the MAKEMENU and
MAKESCRN utilities, both of which can optionally generate code that relies
on the color constants in OpColor.

Note that OpColor does not define any constants for video attributes
greater than $7F. You can, however, achieve the desired effect by adding
'+Blink' to the end of the color name. For example, to create blinking
white-on-red text, you would use the expression 'WhiteOnRed+Blink'. (Blink
is a constant defined in the OpCrt unit.)
