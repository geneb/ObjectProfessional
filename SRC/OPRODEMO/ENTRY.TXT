;
; The first seventeen topics pertain to the data entry fields
;
!TOPIC  1 Name field
This field has only one special characteristic: its picture
mask, CharStr('x', 30), requests that the first letter in
each word automatically be converted to upper case at the
time it is entered. Thus, if the user enters 'john smith',
the result will be 'John Smith'.

Also, like the other fields in ENTRY, this field is cleared
if the first character pressed is an ASCII character, an
option activated with esFieldOptionsOn(efClearFirstChar).
No special validation of input is performed on this field.
;
!TOPIC  2 Address field
This field has only one special characteristic: it is marked as a
required field, meaning that it cannot be left blank. The screen
editor will check its contents both when leaving the field and
when exiting from the screen editor (unless <Esc> has been pressed,
a user-defined exit command has been issued, or the data entry
screen is being exited temporarily in order to process a nested
entry screen such as the one associated with the 6Phones field).
;
!TOPIC  3 City field
This field has only one special characteristic: inserting
new text cannot push existing text off the end of the field,
an option selected with esFieldOptionsOff(efInsertPushes).
No special validation of input is performed on this field.
;
!TOPIC  4 State field
This field, which was added to the entry screen with
AddPickStringField, is "edited" using a pick list created
with OPPICK. Rather than entering an abbreviation for a
state name, the user can simply select one from a list of
valid abbreviations.
;
!TOPIC  5 Zip code field
This field receives special treatment to insure that it is either
entirely blank or else contains a 5- or 9-digit number. Validation
is performed in two ways. First, the picture mask, '99999-9999',
insures that only digits (0-9) or spaces may be entered. Second, a
user-written validation routine, ValidateZip, insures that none
of the first five slots is empty unless the whole field is empty,
and that none of the last four slots is empty unless all four are
empty. If you examine ENTRY.PAS, you'll see that ValidateZip
is a simple routine that relies on the built-in
ValidateSubfields procedure in OPFIELD.
;                 ^--- this attribute used for field/procedure/unit names
;
!TOPIC  6 Phones field
This field is unusual in that it has a nested data entry screen
associated with it. If you move the cursor to this field and press
<Enter>, a window is popped up that contains a secondary entry
screen with two fields on it, 16Work phone and 17Home phone.
This field was added to the main entry screen using the
AddNestedField method.
;
!TOPIC  7 Gender field
;                      v--- ^D signals link to topic 23
This is one of the two 23multiple choice fields in the
program, and it is the more typical of the two. The person's
gender is stored in a variable of an enumerated type
!LINE
  GenderType = (Unknown, Male, Female)
!LINE
and the user simply presses keys until the desired choice is
displayed. To see how this is done, examine the IncChoice
routine in ENTRY.PAS.
;
!TOPIC  8 Marital status field
This field is a standard yes/no field, added by calling
AddYesNoField, and as such it requires no special validation.
The only valid entries are `Y' or `N', and input is automatically
converted to upper case.
;
!TOPIC  9 Date of birth field
This is a Date field and may hold any valid date between January
1, 1900 and December 31, 2078. Validation is done in two ways.
First, the picture mask, usually 'mm/dd/yy', insures that only
digits (0-9) or spaces may be entered. Second, a built-in
validation routine insures that (almost) any date entered is a
legal one. The only illegal date that may be entered,
'00/00/00', is allowed because the lower and upper bounds for
the field are both 0. To force the entry of a legal date, the
constants MinDate and MaxDate (declared in OPDATE) could
be used instead. Notice that the 10Age field is calculated
based on the date of birth.
;
!TOPIC 10 Age field
;         v-- this attribute used for general purpose emphasis
This is a protected field, meaning that its value cannot be
altered directly by the user. It is also a calculated field,
meaning that its value is determined automatically based on that
of another field, in this case the 9Date of birth field. To
see how this is done, examine the PostEdit routine in
ENTRY.PAS. Like the other protected fields in ENTRY, the Age
field is displayed in a different color than unprotected fields.
Unlike the other protected fields, however, it is not displayed
at all if its value is 0.
;
!TOPIC 11 Hourly wage field
This is the only numeric field in the program, at least by the
definition used in OPENTRY. That is, it is the only field that
uses the 22numeric editor, which in this case is requested by
calling AddNumericRealField rather than AddRealField. Although
the most noticeable difference between it and the other fields is
that text is inserted from right to left in calculator fashion,
the command set for the numeric editor is also restricted.
!PAGE
Notice, too, that the value in this field is used, along with
13Hours worked per week, to calculate 12Weekly earnings and
14Yearly earnings.
;
!TOPIC 12 Weekly earnings field
This is a protected field, meaning that its value cannot be
altered directly by the user. It is also a calculated field,
meaning that its value is determined automatically based on that
of another field, in this case the 11Hourly wage and 13Hours
worked per week fields. To see how this is done, examine the
PostEdit routine in ENTRY.PAS. This field is automatically
right-justified because its picture mask contains a fixed decimal
point, and it is padded with asterisks rather than spaces, an option
selected using SetPadChar('*').
;
!TOPIC 13 Hours worked per week field
This is the second of the two 23multiple choice fields in the
program. Unlike the 7Gender field, however, it does not present
the user with a small set of choices corresponding to an
enumerated type. Rather, it presents a default value that may be
incremented or decremented by pressing the <+> or <-> keys. To
see how this is done, examine the IncChoice routine in
ENTRY.PAS.

Notice, too, that the value in this field is used, along with
11Hourly wage, to calculate 12Weekly earnings and 14Yearly
earnings.
;
!TOPIC 14 Yearly earnings field
This field is handled in precisely the same manner as the
12Weekly earnings field.
;
!TOPIC 15 Notes field
This is a memo field created with the routines in OPMEMO. Like
the 6Phones field, the Notes field is displayed by itself in a
popup window when you move the cursor to it and press <Enter>.
The most notable difference between the two is that this field has
a string associated with the field. This effect is achieved by
using AddNestedStringField rather than AddNestedField to add
the field. Although ENTRY never alters this string (NotesMsg),
some applications may wish to change the string associated with
such a field in order to reflect choices made in the nested entry
screen.

The memo editor provides a variety of commands for editing
text, moving the cursor, reformatting text, and so on. Like
OPENTRY, OPMEMO also provides plenty of hooks to allow the
unit to be customized for a particular application. ENTRY uses
one of these hooks, SetStatusProc, to display a customized
status line at the bottom of the editing window, for example.
!PAGE
;   ^----------- force the start of a new screen
The memo editor offers the following commands:

  <Left>, <CtrlS>
  Cursor left one character.

  <Right>, <CtrlD>
  Cursor right one character.

  <CtrlLeft>, <CtrlA>
  Cursor left one word. A 'word' is a series of non-blank
  characters followed by one or more blanks.
!PAGE
  <CtrlRight>, <CtrlF>
  Cursor right one word.

  <Home>, <CtrlQ><S>
  Cursor to beginning of line.

  <End>, <CtrlQ><D>
  Cursor to end of line.

  <Up>, <CtrlE>
  Cursor up one line.
!PAGE
  <Down>, <CtrlX>
  Cursor down one line.

  <CtrlW>
  Scroll display up one line.

  <CtrlZ>
  Scroll display down one line.

  <PgUp>, <CtrlR>
  Scroll display up one page.
!PAGE
  <PgDn>, <CtrlC>
  Scroll display down one page.

  <CtrlHome>, <CtrlQ><E>
  Move cursor to top of edit window.

  <CtrlEnd>, <CtrlQ><X>
  Move cursor to bottom of edit window.

  <CtrlPgUp>, <CtrlQ><R>
  Move cursor to beginning of file.
!PAGE
  <CtrlPgDn>, <CtrlQ><C>
  Move cursor to end of file.

  <ClickLeft>
  Move the cursor to the position indicated by the mouse.

  <Del>, <CtrlG>
  Delete character at cursor.

  <Bksp>, <CtrlH>, <CtrlBksp>
  Delete character to left of cursor.
!PAGE
  <CtrlY>
  Delete current line.

  <CtrlQ><Y>
  Delete from cursor to end of line.

  <CtrlT>
  Delete word to right of cursor.

  <Enter>, <CtrlM>
  Start a new line.
!PAGE
  <Tab>, <CtrlI>
  Move the cursor to the next tab stop.

  <CtrlP>
  Insert control character. For example, to insert a ^G, you
  would enter <CtrlP><CtrlG>.

  <Ins>
  Toggle insert mode on and off. Fat cursor indicates insert
  mode; thin cursor indicates overtype mode.
!PAGE
  <CtrlO><W>
  Toggle word wrap on and off. When word wrap is on, any
  attempt to insert or append text beyond the right margin
  will cause a new line to be inserted, and the word
  currently being entered to be moved to the new line.

  <CtrlO><I>
  Toggle auto-indent mode. In auto-indent mode, pressing
  <Enter> in insert mode causes the new line to have the
  same indentation as the previous line. Auto-indent also
  affects the way text is formatted when word wrap occurs.
!PAGE
  <CtrlB>
  Reformat the current paragraph.

  <AltR>
  Reformat the entire file. Use this command with caution.

  <CtrlQ><L>
  Undo changes to current line and continue editing.

  <Esc>, <CtrlBreak>, <ClickRight>
  Quit editing.
!PAGE
  <F1>, <ClickBoth>
  Help. If a user-written help routine has been established,
  as has been done here, this command invokes that routine.
  Otherwise it does nothing.
;
!TOPIC 16 Work phone field
This field receives special treatment to insure that it is
either entirely blank or contains a complete phone number,
with or without an area code. Validation is performed in two
ways. First, the picture mask, '(999) 999-9999', insures
that only digits (0-9) or spaces may be entered. Second, a
user-written validation routine, ValidatePhone, insures
that none of the last seven slots is empty unless the whole
field is empty, and that none of the first three slots is
empty unless all three are empty. If you examine
ENTRY.PAS, you'll see that ValidatePhone is a simple
routine that relies on the ValidateSubfields procedure in
OPFIELD.
!PAGE
Notice that each sub-field is padded to the right with
underscore characters. This option was selected using
SetPadChar('_'). The underscore characters appear only on
screen; the string being edited is actually padded with
spaces.
;
!TOPIC 17 Home phone field
This field is handled in precisely the same manner as the 16Work
phone field.
;
; The remaining topics are more general...
;
!TOPIC 18 Help on Help
;      v----- force this topic to appear first in the index
!INDEX 1
This demo program has a context-sensitive help system developed
using OPHELP. As you've already discovered, this help system is
similar to the one used by Borland in Turbo Pascal: it is
invoked by pressing <F1>, you can select from an index of help
topics by pressing <F1> a second time, and you can page backward
through a list of previously selected topics by pressing
<AltF1>.

The text for a given topic may also contain links to other topics,
which can be selected by moving the cursor to the appropriate word
or phrase and pressing <Enter>.
;
!TOPIC 19 Editing commands
!INDEX 2
The following are the commands available in the string editor,
which is used for editing most of the fields in ENTRY. Note
that several of these commands are either not available or
behave slightly differently in the 22numeric editor and
23multiple choice editor.

  <Left>, <CtrlS>
  Cursor left one character.

  <Right>, <CtrlD>
  Cursor right one character.
!PAGE
  <CtrlLeft>, <CtrlA>
  Cursor left one word. A 'word' is a series of non-blank
  characters followed by one or more blanks.

  <CtrlRight>, <CtrlF>
  Cursor right one word.

  <Home>, <CtrlQ><S>
  Cursor to beginning of field.
!PAGE
  <End>, <CtrlQ><D>
  Cursor to end of field.

  <Del>, <CtrlG>
  Delete character at cursor.

  <Bksp>, <CtrlH>, <CtrlBksp>
  Delete character to left of cursor.

  <CtrlY>
  Clear entire field.
!PAGE
  <CtrlEnd>, <CtrlQ><Y>
  Delete from cursor to end of subfield.

  <CtrlHome>
  Delete from beginning of subfield to cursor.

  <CtrlT>
  Delete word to right of cursor.
!PAGE
  <Ins>
  Toggle insert mode on and off. Fat cursor indicates insert
  mode; thin cursor indicates overtype mode.

  <CtrlP>
  Insert control character. For example, to insert a ^G, you
  would enter <CtrlP><CtrlG>.

  <CtrlR>, <CtrlQ><L>
  Restore original contents of the field and continue
  editing.
!PAGE
  <F1>
  Help. If a user-written help routine has been established,
  as has been done here, this command invokes that routine.
  Otherwise it does nothing.
;
!TOPIC 20 Field movement commands
!INDEX 3
These commands allow the user to move the cursor from one field
(or subfield) to another:

  <Enter>, <CtrlM>
  Accept contents of field and move to the next one.

  <Tab>, <CtrlI>
  Move cursor to the beginning of the next subfield.

  <ShiftTab>
  Move cursor to the beginning of the previous subfield.
!PAGE
  <Up>, <CtrlE>
  Move cursor to last field above the current one.

  <Down>, <CtrlX>
  Move cursor to last field below the current one.

  <CtrlPgUp>, <CtrlQ><R>
  Move cursor to first field on screen.

  <CtrlPgDn>, <CtrlQ><C>
  Move cursor to last field on screen.
!PAGE
  <PgUp>
  Move cursor to the top line of the entry screen if the
  entry screen is non-scrollable, or to the previous page
  if it is.

  <PgDn>
  Move cursor to the bottom line of the entry screen if the
  entry screen is non-scrollable, or to the next page if
  it is.
;
!TOPIC 21 Exit commands
!INDEX 4
An exit command is a command that causes control to pass
from the entry screen manager back to the main program,
which must react to the command. The following are the
standard pre-assigned exit commands:

  <CtrlEnter>, <CtrlK><D>, <CtrlK><Q>
  Quit editing. Accepts all changes to the current field.

  <Esc>, <CtrlBreak>
  Abort. Restores the original value of the current field.
!PAGE
The programmer may also define as many as 56 additional exit
commands: ccUser0..ccUser55. In ENTRY, there are three
user-defined exit commands:

  <CtrlPgUp>
  Quit editing the current record and start editing the
  previous one. Accepts all changes to the current field.
  Note that <CtrlPgUp> is actually assigned to the standard
  exit command ccPrevRec, which is normally not associated
  with a keystroke.

  <CtrlPgDn>
  Quit editing the current record and start editing the next
  one. Accepts all changes to the current field. Note that
  <CtrlPgDn> is actually assigned to the standard exit
  command ccNextRec, which is normally not associated with
  a keystroke.

  <AltB>
  Toggles the error bell on and off.
;
!TOPIC 22 Numeric editor
!INDEX 5
The numeric editor is designed exclusively for entering and
editing numbers. It works much like a calculator, meaning that the
cursor is always positioned at the far right edge of the field and
digits are always inserted at the end, pushing previously entered
digits to the left.

The numeric editor also has one command not found in the 19string
editor or the 23multiple choice editor:

  <->
  Changes the sign of the number being entered.
;
!TOPIC 23 Multiple choice editor
!INDEX 6
This special-purpose editor is designed to edit two kinds of
fields: those associated with enumerated types, and those
associated with numeric values that need to be adjusted in
incremental fashion.

In comparison with the 19string editor, the multiple choice editor
offers a restricted command set. There are no commands for
inserting or deleting text, nor are there any commands for moving
the cursor within the field itself. The only cursor commands
available are those which move the cursor to another field.
!PAGE
The multiple choice editor does, however, offer two commands not
implemented in the 19string editor or the 22numeric editor:

  <+>, <Space>
  Select next choice, or increment value.

  <->
  Select previous choice, or decrement value.

Note that you may alter these key assignments, if desired,
by calling EntryCommands.AddCommand.
;
!TOPIC 24 Mouse functions
!INDEX 7
Thanks to the low-level facilities in OPMOUSE and other
units in Object Professional, ENTRY is able to provide
extensive mouse support. While editing fields, you can do
the following things using a mouse (if one is installed):

- Move the mouse cursor (shaped like a diamond) to any
  unprotected field on the data entry screen and select it
  by clicking the left mouse button
!LINE
- Move the mouse cursor to the 6Phones field and click
  the left mouse button: the secondary entry screen
  associated with it will be popped up
!LINE
- Move the mouse cursor to the 8Marital status field and
  click the left mouse button once to select it, a second
  time to toggle its value
!LINE
- Move the mouse cursor to the 13Hours worked per week or
  7Gender field and click the left mouse button once to
  select the field, a second time to increment the value
!LINE
- Press the right mouse button to simulate pressing the
  <Esc> key
!LINE
- Press both mouse buttons (the left and the right) to bring
  up the help screen for the current field
!PAGE
- Press the center mouse button (on three-button mice only)
  to simulate pressing <Enter>

You can also use the mouse when selecting from pick lists,
when using the help system, and when responding to prompts for
a single keypress (in general, clicking the right button does
the same thing as pressing <Esc>, while clicking the left
button does the same thing as pressing <Enter>).
