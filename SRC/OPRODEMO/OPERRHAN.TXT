!TOPIC 1259 OpErrHan
How can a program recover from a runtime error and continue processing?
Object Professional provides the answer with the OpErrHan unit.

OpErrHan works by tapping into the Turbo Pascal runtime error handler.
Control is diverted from the normal System unit to a routine defined by
OpErrHan. The OpErrHan routine classifies errors as recoverable or
fatal, computes where control should return upon recovery, optionally calls
a user-defined function, and finally returns to the program or to the
System error handler as required.

procedure 1259OpErrHan.ErrorRecovery(On : Boolean; UserRoutine : Pointer);

Call this procedure to activate or deactivate runtime error recovery. If
the On parameter is True, error recovery is activated; otherwise it is
deactivated and Turbo Pascal's normal error handling system is used.
UserRoutine is a pointer to a user-defined function which can further
customize the error handling behavior of an application. If you don't want
to define such a user function, simply pass the value Nil in this position.

var
  CanRecover : Boolean;

Because OpErrHan must patch into Turbo's runtime system, its
initialization code checks carefully to find the right patch point. If all
goes well, OpErrHan sets CanRecover to True.
