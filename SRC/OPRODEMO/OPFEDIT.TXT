!TOPIC 1289 OpFEdit
OpFEdit serves as a supplement to 1291OpField, and contains five field
editors that together are too large to fit in OpField. The following is a
brief summary of the five field editors, with emphasis on the differences
among them.

StringEditor
!LINE
Used for editing almost all of the field types supported by OpField in
cases where the field has a true picture mask (i.e., a "regular" field).
Although it works with a wide variety of data types, it is oriented toward
the editing of strings rather than numbers. Its most noteworthy feature is
its ability to scroll a field horizontally to permit the editing of strings
that are longer than the field itself.

SimpleStringEditor
!LINE
Used for editing all "simple" fields except those handled by
SimpleCharEditor. Although similar to StringEditor, it cannot handle fields
with true picture masks. It assumes that all characters in the picture mask
are the same as the first, and it uses this character only to determine
which characters are acceptable and to adjust their case. Like
StringEditor, it can scroll a field horizontally if necessary.

NumberEditor
!LINE
Special-purpose editor used exclusively for entering and editing numbers
(integer, real, BCD). Works much like a calculator: the cursor is always
positioned at the far right edge of the field, and digits are always
inserted at the end, pushing previously entered digits to the left. Cursor
movement commands are always treated as exit commands: ccLeft, for example,
is interpreted to mean "move the cursor to the field to the left."
NumberEditor correctly displays discretionary commas and floating dollar
signs as text is being entered. A field that uses this editor is referred
to as a "numeric" field.

CalcEditor
!LINE
A calculator-style editor similar to NumberEditor that works more like a
calculator. The main differences between the two editors are 1) the new one
requires the user to enter decimal points manually, and 2) the new one
can display more than the specified number of decimal places while the
field is being edited. For example, suppose that the picture mask
specified for the field is '999,999.99'. The user could enter
'1234.5678', which would be displayed as '1,234.5678'. When the cursor
left the field, the display would be updated to conform to the picture
mask, i.e.: ' 1,234.57'. If UseCalcEdit is defined in OPDEFINE.INC, this
editor is automatically used in place of NumberEditor for numeric fields.

CharEditor
!LINE
Used for editing "regular" fields of type Char, Boolean, and YesNo.
Although it does work with picture masks, it assumes that there is only one
formatting character in the mask, and it always positions the cursor on the
first one that it finds in the field. Treats cursor movement commands as
exit commands.

SimpleCharEditor
!LINE
Used for editing "simple" fields of type Char, Boolean, and YesNo. The
principal difference between it and the CharEditor is that it assumes that
the field is one character wide.

!TOPIC 1290 ClearFirstFunc,OpFEdit
!NOINDEX
type
  ClearFirstFunc = function(var Cmd, Key : Word) : Boolean;

A function called by a field editor when the ClearFirstChar option is in
effect to determine whether or not a given command (Cmd) should cause the
field to be cleared. The function should return True if the field should be
cleared. The default function returns True only if Cmd = ccChar.
